## Description
A fitness tracker application built using Node.js with an Express.js server, and MongoDB using Mongoose. This was my first time using MongoDB and Mongoose to build a full application, and I was able to draw similarities and differences with MySQL and Sequelize. 

## Installation
Navigate to ```./fitness-tracker```

Run the following command from the terminal: 

```npm i```

## Usage
This application is deployed to Heroku at [mels-fitness-tracker.herokuapp.com](https://mels-fitness-tracker.herokuapp.com/). 

To run the application on a local server, follow the following steps: 

1. Ensure MongoDB is installed and set up on your computer before using this application. A guide can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

2. Navigate to ```./fitness-tracker```

3. Open a new terminal and run the following commands:
```npm run seed```
```npm start```
